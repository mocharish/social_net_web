In this FeedBook page you can create a new user, sign in and then access the feed page. In the feed page there is content and you can add posts, comments, likes and other actions.

How to run:

1. Clone the repository

2. Compile the code - make sure you ate on the right path and install dependicies

3. Open the project by running npm start, this will take you to localhost:3000.

4. To sign in, first you need to register. Fill in all the fields of new account according to the guide lines. After creating new account enter user name and password to sign in. We used a built in user for entering - name: yosi@gmail.com, password: 1234. 

5. In the feed page there is button to add posts, you can also delete, like, edit and comment on posts.  In the top right of the page the is an arrow down button, by clicking on it a dropdown menu appears in which you can change page to dark mode and log out.  You can only edit posts that you added (not the built in postrs)


 Workflow:  after fully reading and understanding the project, we began working on the web.  We split up the work in which, one started to work on the sign up and one on the feed, each on a different branch. We merged the codes when we needed to access info from the other. We also made tests in order to clarify that our components work.
